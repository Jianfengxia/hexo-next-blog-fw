      3. price of inputs (price of electronic chip decreases)
      4. expectations

   4. Markets exist because:
      1. Demanders have demand (they are willing to pay money to have things)
      2. Suppliers have supply (they are willing to accept money to sell things)
      3. As long as there are demanders and suppliers, there will be markets (producers sell thingsto consumers)
   5. Market equilibrium - quantity supplied = quantity demanded
