1. Introduction to Stats, Data and Graphing Data
   1. Nature of Data:
      1. Qualitative: dealing with characteristics of objects – such as gender, grade, colour, country
      2. Quantitative: dealing with numbers, numerical data. These numbers are usually arising from some sort of scale
   2. Statistics has two branches
      1. definitions: Population, Census, Sample
      2. descriptive statistics - a group data to describe or reach conclusions about that same group
      3. inferential statistics - a sample data to reach conclusions about the population from which the sample was taken
   3. Data Measurement:
      1. Nominal Data: used to categorise (Gender, Tel, Post code, etc)
      2. Ordinal Data: e.g. rank performance of employees
      3. Interval Data: e.g. Temperature – degrees Celsius
      4. Retio Data: e.g. Sales, Time volume
   4. Categorical vs. Numerical
   5. Inferential Methods
   6. Data Timing:
      1. Cross Sectional
      2. Time Series
2. Charts and Graphs
   1. Grouped Data: data that have been organised into a frequency distribution
   2. Ungrouped Data: raw data, or data that have not been summarised
   3. Frequency Distribution: a summary of data presented in the form of class intervals and frequencies
   4. Range: the difference between the largest and the smallest values in a set of data
   5. Relative Frequency = Individual frequency / Total frequency
   6. Cumulative Frequency = Frequency Above + This Record’s Frequency
3. Descriptive Statistics
   1. Describing Measures of Location
      1. Mean: average of data values
      2. Median: middle observation of the ordered data
      3. Mode: most frequent
      4. Percentiles: data broken into groupings of 10% of ordered data in each group
      5. Quartiles: data broken into 25% of ordered scores per group. Used for box & whisker plots
   2. Notation:
      1. i = observation number
      2. n = sample size
      3. ∑ = summation
      4. x = variable
      5. x1 = value of variable x at observation i
   3. ...
4. Probability
   1. Classical Method
   2. Relative Frequency of Occurrence Method
   3. Subjective Probabilities
   4. ...
5. Discrete Probability Distributions
   1. Discrete Distributions describe discrete random variables
      1. Binomial distribution - like ‘success or failure’
      2. Poisson distribution
      3. Hypergeometric distribution
   2. Continuous Distributions
      1. Normal distribution
      2. Uniform distribution
      3. Exponential distribution
      4. t distribution
      5. chi-square distribution
      6. F Distribution.
6. Sampling and Sampling Distributions
   1. Parameters & Population vs. Statistics and Samples
   2. Random Sampling Techniques
      1. Simple random sampling
      2. Stratified random sampling
      3. Systematic random sampling
      4. Cluster (area) random sampling
   3. Finite vs. Infinite Populations
   4. Central Limit Theorem
7. Statistical Inference: Interval Estimation for a Single Population
8. Statistical Inference: Hypothesis Testing for Single Populations
9. Statistical Inference: For Two Populations
10. Simple Regression Analysis
11. Multiple Regression Analysis
