1. Economic of Life - Choice and rational behavior
   1. Microeconomics: study of choices individuals and firms make and the implications of these choices
   2. Macroeconomics: study of the economy on a regional, national, or international scale
   3. 4 main questions for decisions
      1. Scarcity - wants vs. constraints
      2. Opportunity cost
         1. tradeoffs between costs and benefits
         2. Rule of thumb: choose the activity with lowest opportunity cost and greatest benefit
         3. Marginal decisions - sunk costs
      3. Incentives
      4. Efficiency - Innovation, Market failure, Intervention, Goals other than profit
   4. Correlation and causation
      1. Correlation without causation
      2. Omitted variable
      3. Reverse causation
2. Production Possibility
   1. Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)
   2. Opportunity costs - O.C. = Give up / gain
   3. Convex PPFs
3. Market
   1. Four characteristics of perfectly competitive market
      1. Standardized good
      2. No transaction costs
      3. Full information
      4. Participants (buyer and producer) are price takers
   2. five most important non-price determinant demand are:
      1. Preferences
      2. Number of buyers (more buyers increases demand)
      3. incomes
      4. expectation (about the future cost of the good)
      5. price of related goods (substitutes or complements)
   3. 5 most important non-price determinants of supply:
      1. Technology
      2. number of producers
      3. price of inputs (price of electronic chip decreases)
      4. expectations
      5. price of related goods (inputs)
   4. Markets exist because:
      1. Demanders have demand (they are willing to pay money to have things)
      2. Suppliers have supply (they are willing to accept money to sell things)
      3. As long as there are demanders and suppliers, there will be markets (producers sell thingsto consumers)
   5. Market equilibrium - quantity supplied = quantity demanded
   6. Disequilibrium - A surplus (excess supply) or A shortage
4. Elasticity
   1. Price elasticity of demand = %change of quantity /%change of price
   2. actors determines consumer's responsiveness to price changes
      1. availability of substitutes
      2. Degree of necessity
      3. cost relative to income
      4. adjustmen time
5. Efficiency
   1. Consumer surplus
   2. Producer surplus
   3. Market equilibrium and efficiency
6. Government Intervention
   1. 3 reasons
      1. correcting market failures (The situation in which the assumption of efficient competitive markets fails to hold)
      2. changing the distribution of benefits (by imposing minimum wages policy)
      3. Encouraging or discouraging consumption of certain goods (Tax)
   2. Welfare effects of a price ceiling
   3. Welfare effects of price floor
      1. Dead Weight Loss (DWL) = (consumer surplus + producer surplus) before - (consumer surplus + producer surplus) after
7. Consumer Behaviors
   1. Marginal utility
   2. Marginal rate of substitution (MRS)
8. Behavioral Economics
   1. commitment devices - Thinking irrationally about costs which leads to irrational decisions
   2. sunk cost - Undervaluing opportunity cost
   3. Fungible - easily exchangeable or substitutable
9. Game Theory and Strategies
   1. Behave strategically
   2. Rules, strategies, and payoffs
   3. The Prisoners' dilemma
   4. Dominant Strategy - if choices differ depending on the choice of others, then no dominant strategy
   5. Nash equilibrium - non-cooperative equilibrium
   6. Commitment strategies
   7. First mover advantage
10. Information: knowledge is power
    1. Information asymmetry
       1. Adverse selection - lemons problem in the used-car market
       2. Moral Hazard - renege (betray) on contracts
    2. Solving information problem
11. The Cost of Production
    1. Marginal cost is needed to study optimal choices
    2. Average costs are needed to study the structure of firms and the profit/loss
    3. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
    4. Variable costs
    5. Explicit and implicit costs
    6. Accounting profit = total revenue - explicit costs
    7. Economic profit = accounting profit - implicit costs = total revenue - (explicit cost + implicit cost)
    8. Ave. fixed cost (AFC) = fixed cost / quantity of output
    9. Ave. variable cost (AVC) = variable cost / quantity of output
    10. Ave. total cost (ATC) = total costs/ quantity = AFC+AVC
    11. Marginal cost (MC) = change in total cost/ change in quantity of output
    12. Costs in the long run
    13. Returns to scale
    14. Efficient scale
12. Perfect Competition
    1. Profits and production decision
       1. Profit-maximizing when marginal revenue (MR) = marginal cost(MC)
       2. Average revenue = (P x Q)/Q = P (Price)
       3. profit-maximizing quantity when MR = MC
    2. Firm's decision: profits and losses
       1. revenue per unit (=price) is more than total cost per unit (ATC): P>AFC+AVC
       2. revenue per unit (=price) is less than total cost per unit (ATC) but more than variable cost per unit (AVC): firm loses money: P < AFC+AVC
       3. The short-run supply curve and the shutdown rule
       4. Long run decision
       5. long run point
          1. in the long run, there is no profit or loss. it has to be at the point P=ATC
          2. the rule of optimal choice is MC=MR
          3. MC crosses ATC at the minimum point of ATC
          4. in the long run , P=min(ATC)=MR=MC
          5. competition forces production at the minimum cost. most efficient
13. Monopoly
    1. Monopolists and the demand curve
    2. Monopoly revenue
    3. Monopoly profit-maximizing quantity
    4. The welfare costs of monopoly
    5. Public policy responses: Antitrust law
14. Monopolistic Competition and oligopoly
    1. perfectly competition: no market power
    2. Monopoly: full market power
    3. monopolistic competition: some market power
    4. Monopolistic competition in the short run
    5. Monopolistic competition in the long run
    6. Welfare costs of monopolistic competition
15. Factors of Production
    1. Picking the right combination of inputs
    2. Choice: MC=MB (marginal benefit = MR)
    3. Determinants of labor demand and supply
    4. Supply of labor
    5. 3 major Determinants of labor supply
       1. Culture (some culture working too hard is not appreciated)
       2. Population (increase population -increase supply)
       3. Other opportunities

       2. Ronald Coase
    4. Dealing with negative externalities: Tax
